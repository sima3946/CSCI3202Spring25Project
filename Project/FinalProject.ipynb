    "From the code above, we have successfully implemented the Game class from the aima library games4e to include the Game class in the Mancala game itself. We have also successfully implemented a random player that is able to choose from a list of valid moves to play, and we have also extended this to be able to play 100 games of a random player vs a random player to show the statistics of what randomness looks like in this game. From the results above, we have determined that each player wins roughly 50% of the time, with a small number of ties (3%). On average, it takes about 23 moves for a player to win the game. We have also implemented all of the rules of the Mancala game as described in the Project Guidelines."

    "Given our code, we have run 100 games using a MiniMax player against a Random Player. The results show that 90% of the time, the AI player will win with 3 ties and 7 losses. On the other hand, the Random Player performs at a significantly worse level with only 7 wins and 90 losses, along with 3 ties. On average, It takes the AI player around 18 turns to win the game. The Random Player, on average, takes about 17 turns to win as well. \n",

    "Here, the AI performs better than the Random Player due to the algorithm that MiniMax uses to choose the best possible move. Since the MiniMax player is the Max player, it chooses a move such that the Random Player will be at a disadvantage when the game enters a terminal state. Rather than randomly choosing a pit to take stones from, there is a choice made that will maximize the advantage for the MiniMax player. As seen with the statistics, the AI player wins 90% of the time, which, when compared to the Random Player vs Random Player game, shows that the AI player wins far more than 50% of the games. "

    "In this case, the AI player once again performs better than the Random Player due to the Algorithm of Alpha-Beta Pruning. Since it is a version of MiniMax, with the only difference being that nodes that are not considered will be pruned, it once again chooses the move that will maximize the advantage for the Max player (i.e. the AI player) while simultaneously putting the Min player (Random Player) at a disadvantage when choosing a move. A game, on average, takes about 0.02 seconds to run using this algorithm. In comparison to the MiniMax algorithm, it can be seen that Alpha Beta performs worse with about a 2% decrease in performance, most likely due to pruning decisions as opposed to looking at all possible choices that might give the AI player an advantage.

    "It takes about 2.41 sconds to run a single game to completion. The AI player with Alpha-Beta wins 99% of the games while the Random player only wins 1% of games. It takes about 16 moves for the AI player to win a game.\n",

    "This new utility function looks at all aspects of future gameplay instead of just analyzing terminal states. For the original utility function, it simply looks at the score at that moment without considering the amount of stones that are still on the board. With our new utility function, we are able to analyze future potential alongside the score at that moment. This is through looking at the landscape of the board and analyzing the positions of the stones that are in the pits alongside working with the number of stones in the Mancala. With this, the AI is able to be more calculating and strategic instead of simply using the current Mancala score to find its next move. Also, the AI is less likely to make moves that focus on getting little gains into the Mancala at the expense of long-term strategies that can get more stones into the Mancala if played correctly.\n",

    "As we increase the number of plies to 10, we are allowing our AI to view deeper into our game tree. With this, the AI is able to view a lot further down the line and see how a certain move can impact the game many turns later. Incrasing the amount of piles works to help our AI have a better long-term strategy and implement moves that are designed to build towards a much larger goal than trying to find short-term gains when we can. That is the issue with working at smaller depths as the AI can appear more greedy and simply do moves that help at the time but do not have much thought in them towards having an intricate strategy to win the game.\n",

    "The new utility function is a better way to evaluate the strength of a particular match. We spoke about this a bit in the first question above but this is because we are considering the current score and the future potential for scoring. Looking at the original utility function, we are only looking at the stones that are in the Mancala. With this new utility function, we are considering the stones that are in the pits and are still in play. As we consider the positions of the stones that are not in the Mancala, we are able to create a much better strategy in terms of controlling the board and making moves that take advantage of the current positioning as posed to simply looking at short-term gains by increasing the amount of stones in the Mancala."
